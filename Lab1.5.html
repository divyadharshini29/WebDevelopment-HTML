                    <b>Anthropology</b><br>
                    Anthropology is the holistic study of human cultures. It deals with our origins; physical and cultural development; biological characteristics; belief systems; social, political,and economic organization; and customs of peoples and cultures. Through the many perspectives of anthropology, the field is linked to psychology, biology, sociology,chemistry, medicine, history, and the earth sciences. Because of its broad and holistic approach to the study of culture, anthropology is unique in comparison to other fields of inquiry<br>

                    <b>English</b><br>
                    In the English Department, students learn to read and write critically, and to think and conduct research independently. Their intellectual horizons are broadened through an introduction to works from a range of historical periods and countries around the world. The major helps them become fluent in critical methods—historicism, race and gender studies, formal and textual analysis—that they can apply not just to literature, but also to the representations at the heart of their rapidly changing world. Students develop higher-level writing and thinking skills that support careers in teaching, publishing, law, journalism, communications, the mental health professions and business.<br>

                    <b>Philosophy</b><br>
                    Philosophy is the rational inquiry into our most basic beliefs and values. Socrates famously said, “The unexamined life is not worth living.” This examination involves seeking answers to questions such as: How should I live? • What is truth? • How is the mind related to the body? • Do we have free will? • What is justice? • How should we make ethical judgments when there seems to be no clear right or wrong answer? • Are we more likely to know what is real through reason or through the senses? • How am I related to the world and to others? • What is the value of art? • How does technology mediate our engagement with the world and with others? A philosopher’s examination into these and other issues is grounded on evidence, reasoning, and argument. If you are a curious person who enjoys intellectual challenges, then you may find a philosophy classroom invigorating.<br>

                    <b>Linguistics</b><br>
                    Language is the only complex form of communication common to all humans. It is essential for all interpersonal endeavors and is central to the development and maintenance of societies, cultures and civilizations. Yet there are many unanswered questions about how language is acquired, processed by the brain, structured and used. Linguistics is engaged in answering these questions.<br>
